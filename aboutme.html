        <h3>Interesting Facts</h3>
    <p>I am a 22 year old college student, and while my major is 
        Computer Science, I am currently working with a company in Japan to help me teach English there. 
        I also do a lot of content creation, and love trying new things. </b>.</p>

        <h3>Madoka Magica: Rebellion</h3>
        <p>My favorite movie would probably be the Madoka Magica movie, just because
            the series is absolutely amazing, and the different twists and turns
            keep you engaged throughout the entire thing.

                <td>This can range from about $20 to well over $200, depending on how much you enjoy it</td>
                <td>How much you spend, depends on how competitive you are, or how much you generally enjoy it. You should expect to spend at least 400 on a console. I personally spend well over 3000 on my PC</td>
                <td>This one is completely free! Only thing you need to pay is your time, as learning can be very time consuming</td>
