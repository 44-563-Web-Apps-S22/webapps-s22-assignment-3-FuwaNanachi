        <h3>Interesting Facts</h3>
    <p>I am a 22 year old college student, and while my major is 
        Computer Science, I am currently working with a company in Japan to help me teach English there. 
        I also do a lot of content creation, and love trying new things. </b>.</p>

        <h3>Madoka Magica: Rebellion</h3>
        <p>My favorite movie would probably be the Madoka Magica movie, just because
            the series is absolutely amazing, and the different twists and turns
            keep you engaged throughout the entire thing.

        <h3>Things I like</h3>
        <p>This will be about things that I enjoy doing, as well as how much you should expect
            to spend
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>HEMA</th>
                <th>Gaming</th>
                <th>Dancing</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>You can practice hema, or european sword play, just about anywhere. As for places to learn, you would just need to look up a dojo near you.</td>
                <td>Gaming can be done from anywhere, and houses all sorts of people</td>
                <td>Truly something you can do anywhere, as long as there's a beat and a will to dance</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>This can range from about $20 to well over $200, depending on how much you enjoy it</td>
                <td>How much you spend, depends on how competitive you are, or how much you generally enjoy it. You should expect to spend at least 400 on a console. I personally spend well over 3000 on my PC</td>
                <td>This one is completely free! Only thing you need to pay is your time, as learning can be very time consuming</td>

        <h3> Convex hull trick and Li Chao tree</h3>
        <p>The idea of this approach is to maintain a lower convex hull of linear functions. Actually it would be a bit more convenient to consider them not as linear functions, but as points (k;b) on the plane such that we will have to find the point which has the least dot product with a given point (x;1), that is, for this point kx+b is minimized which is the same as initial problem. </p>
